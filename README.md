This is a reanalysis of the publicly available single cell sequencing of the nodose ganglia (Zhao, Q., Yu, C.D., Wang, R. et al. A multidimensional coding architecture of the vagal interoceptive system. Nature 603, 878–884 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038). 

The dataset contains -
1. ‘control’ scRNASeq where vagal ganglia were collected from 40 mice and divided into 4 samples) and 
2. ‘Projection-seq’ where 30 mice were first injected with AAVs (containing UPB) into various thoracic and abdominal organs and then their vagal ganglia were collected and divided into 4 samples.

Goals:
1. Use the barcoded data for supra –vs- subdiaphragmatic comparison. Compare this with Gastric enriched genes determined from the proteomic data.

2. Top marker genes for the VSNs labeled from the different organs.
